      <p>iOS first (early 2026), followed by iPadOS (mid 2026). We want to get the iPhone experience right before expanding to iPad.</p>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is my data really private?</summary>
      <p>Completely. GardenOS stores everything locally on your device. If you enable iCloud sync, your data syncs through your personal iCloud account - we never see it. No analytics, no tracking, no data collection.</p>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Why only 3 plants on the free plan?</summary>
      <p>We want GardenOS to be sustainable without ads or data mining. The free plan lets you try the app fully, and the Pro subscription keeps development going.</p>
